        I was raised in and around Clinton, TN. I moved to Biloxi for training when I joined the Air Force, then my first assignment was to Las Vegas. I moved to Warrenton, VA for my next assignment.

    <h1>Places I'd Like to Visit</h1>
    <p>
        I'd like to visit Reykjavik to tour around Iceland and see the northern lights. I would like to visit Kaiserslautern again, because I was only there for a short time for a work trip and did not have time to explore. I would like to visit Oslo as a starting point to visit many Northern European countries.
